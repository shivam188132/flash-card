# Flash Card App

Welcome to Flash Card App! This project implements a flash card application in Python, leveraging the pandas library to extract a dictionary of words from CSV data. Using the tkinter module, the app displays French words on the screen, prompting users to guess their meanings. After a brief 5-second interval, the correct meaning is revealed. 

To track user performance, two buttons, 'True' and 'False,' allow users to indicate the accuracy of their guesses. The app dynamically updates a score, providing users with feedback on their performance. To facilitate learning from mistakes, all errors are logged and stored in a new CSV file named 'words_to_learn.' This personalized learning approach ensures users focus on areas that need improvement, fostering an effective language learning experience.
